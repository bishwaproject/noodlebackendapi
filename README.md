Back end api for noodle restaurant
## Requirement:
Noodle selling restaurant wants to have backend in reliable tech, when customer visit their website and click order now button, then 'noodlebackendapi' comes into picture.
When the frontend has an "Order Now" button, the backend needs to handle the order request and process the necessary information. 
### Used technology
I found java (Spring boot) is one of the reliable backend tools to achive that. SpringBoot is a popular and suitable backend option for developing selling API for serveral reasons:
1. Rapid Development: Spring boot provides a streamlined development experience with auto-configuration and opinionated defaults. It reduces boilerplat code and enables developers to quickly build RESTful API(S) by focusing on business logic rather than infrastructure setup.
2. Spring Ecosystem: Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring framework, which is a mature and widely adopted framework in the java ecosystem. It offers a comprehensive set of libraries and modules for building enterprise-grade applications, including database access, security, testing, and more.
3. Convention over configuration: Spring boot follows the principle of "convention over configuration", which means it provides sensible defaults and configurations out-of-the-box. This reduces the need for manual configuration and allows developers to start building API(S) with minimal setup.
4. Dependency Management: Spring Boot simlifies dependency management through its built-in dependency management tool. It resolves and manages the versions of the required libraries, making it easier to add and update dependencies in the project.
5. Integration Capabilities: Spring Boot offers seamless integration with various technilogies and frameworks commonly used in web development. It provides robust support for working with databases, such as JDBC and JPA, and supports popular frontend frameworks and libraries for building modern web applications.
6. Microservices Support:
